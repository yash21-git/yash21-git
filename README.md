## Hi there my name is YASHðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently working on public policy analytics projects involving inequality decomposition, macroeconomic forecasting, and customer behavior analysis as a Research Intern at RBI, Mumbai.

Currently learning advanced data visualization with Tableau and generative AI tools for policy applications.

looking to collaborate on impactful data-driven research in economics, digital inclusion, or civic tech.

Ask me about SQL, Stata, Python (pandas, statsmodels), policy evaluation, or data storytelling!

âš¡ Fun fact: I once cleaned over 1 million rows of messy household consumption data just for funâ€”and visualized it over coffee!
